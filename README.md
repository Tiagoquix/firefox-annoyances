# Introduction

Mozilla Firefox is a great browser. However, Mozilla keeps introducing useless/bloated Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence) features in their browser in order to "keep up" with competition.

I find them annoying, but there are many inconsistent recommendations across the internet to disable them in `about:config`. This repository shall serve as a centralized way for users to contribute new preferences as a quick way for people to use in their `user.js`.

# Deactivations

Currently, the following is disabled in Mozilla Firefox by this project:

- Everything that uses Machine Learning â€” this includes in-browser local translations and alternative text that is auto-generated for PDF files.
- Mozilla self-promotion inside their Firefox browser (Mozilla VPN, Mozilla Focus, "More from Mozilla" and so on).

# How to use

The `annoyances.js` file can be used as a standalone file, but I would recommend you to use it in conjuction with [Arkenfox's user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). It's a great template, and things that are covered there won't be covered here.

To use this as a standalone thing, you can download the `annoyances.js` file, install it into the `Root Directory` of the Firefox profile you are using (see `about:profiles`) and rename it to `user.js`.

To use it in conjuction with Arkenfox, append the contents of `annoyances.js` to your `user-overrides.js` file.

# Syntax explanation

```javascript
// Syntax explanation:
// We have three options: boolean, number and string
//
// Boolean: "true" or "false"
// Number: 1, 2, 3
// String is a specific text: "www.example.com"
//
// For Booleans and Numbers, this syntax should be used:
user_pref("preference.name", VALUE);
// Where VALUE is either true/false/a number.
// It should not be in quotes, unless the preference accepts multiple VALUEs.
//
// For Strings, this syntax should be used:
user_pref("preference.name", "STRING");
// Where STRING must be in quotes
```
